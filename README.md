# Geoquiz

Maps and competitions are strong tools to combine if you want people to interact with data. The project began by using geographic names and evolved into a more geo-historic frame, using Wikidata - always on the look for better ways of using data and accessing information, knowledge bases. 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.23.

## Using Wikidata - The Battles

The Battles have been created by using wikidata query service, downloaded to PostGIS and rated. The rating was necessary in order to have a 'easy' and 'hard' questions mixture. Admittedly, labelling something 'easy' is highly idiosyncratic.

## Using Wikidata - UNESCO Heritage sites

The Sites have been created by using wikidata query service, downloaded to PostGIS and rated. The rating was necessary in order to have a 'easy' and 'hard' questions mixture. Admittedly, labelling something 'easy' is highly idiosyncratic and eurocentric to say the least.
